This is a simple web application that makes a ping to Chat-GPT upon a user entering a comma-separated list of ingredients that they have lying around / in the fridge. The idea came to me due to my love of cooking, and observation that many of the people I know who see my cooking are always asking me how I do it. With the rise of food delivery apps, I feel like many people these days are averse to cooking, believing it's hard / they lack the skill / there's too much going on. This app is my attempt to make cooking easy and accessible, no matter what ingredients you have at home!
